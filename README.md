# Social Anxiety Simulation

This is a Unity3D project created with Virtual Reality in mind.
The goal of this simulation is to provide a realistic scenario for people struggling with social anxiety to practice their coping mechanisms.

I collaborated with 2 other students on this project, however I wrote a vast majority of the scripts.
